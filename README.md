# API as a Service Design Specification

## 1. System Overview

Our API as a Service platform is designed to collect, transform, and serve data from various sources in customizable formats. The system is built on a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.

## 2. Technology Stack

### 2.1 Programming Languages
- Go: For high-performance microservices
- Python: For data processing and machine learning tasks
- JavaScript (Node.js): For web scraping and some microservices

### 2.2 Databases
- PostgreSQL: Primary relational database
- MongoDB: Document store for unstructured data
- ClickHouse: For analytics and time-series data
- Redis: For caching and pub/sub messaging

### 2.3 Message Broker
- Apache Kafka: For event streaming and data pipeline

### 2.4 Data Processing
- Apache Spark: For batch processing
- Apache Flink: For stream processing

### 2.5 API Gateway
- Kong: For API management, authentication, and rate limiting

### 2.6 Service Mesh
- Istio: For service-to-service communication, security, and observability

### 2.7 Container Orchestration
- Kubernetes: For deploying and managing microservices

### 2.8 Monitoring and Observability
- Prometheus: For metrics collection
- Grafana: For metrics visualization
- Jaeger: For distributed tracing
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): For log management

### 2.9 CI/CD
- GitLab CI: For continuous integration and deployment

### 2.10 Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform: For provisioning and managing cloud resources

### 2.11 Cloud Provider
- AWS: Primary cloud provider

## 3. System Architecture

The system is composed of the following main components:

1. Data Ingestion Layer
2. Data Storage Layer
3. Data Processing Layer
4. API Layer
5. Monitoring and Observability Layer

### 3.1 Data Ingestion Layer

Microservices:
- Web Scraper Service (Node.js)
- REST Ingestion Service (Go)
- Streaming Ingestion Service (Go)

These services will push data to Kafka topics for further processing.

### 3.2 Data Storage Layer

- Raw Data Lake: AWS S3
- Processed Data: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ClickHouse
- Cache: Redis

### 3.3 Data Processing Layer

Microservices:
- Stream Processing Service (Go with Apache Flink)
- Batch Processing Service (Python with Apache Spark)
- ML Processing Service (Python)

### 3.4 API Layer

Microservices:
- GraphQL API Service (Go)
- REST API Service (Go)
- API Gateway (Kong)

### 3.5 Monitoring and Observability Layer

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for dashboards
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- ELK Stack for log management

## 4. API Routes

### 4.1 Data Ingestion API

```
POST /v1/ingest
POST /v1/ingest/batch
POST /v1/ingest/stream
```

### 4.2 Data Retrieval API

```
GET /v1/data/{source}/{id}
GET /v1/data/{source}/search
POST /v1/data/query (for complex queries)
```

### 4.3 Data Transformation API

```
POST /v1/transform
POST /v1/transform/custom
```

### 4.4 Account Management API

```
POST /v1/account/create
GET /v1/account/{id}
PUT /v1/account/{id}
DELETE /v1/account/{id}
```

### 4.5 API Key Management

```
POST /v1/apikey/generate
GET /v1/apikey/{id}
DELETE /v1/apikey/{id}
```

### 4.6 Usage and Billing API

```
GET /v1/usage/{account_id}
GET /v1/billing/{account_id}
```

## 5. Data Flow

1. Data is ingested through the Data Ingestion Layer and published to Kafka topics.
2. Stream Processing Service consumes data from Kafka, processes it in real-time, and stores the results in the appropriate database.
3. Batch Processing Service periodically processes data from the data lake for historical analysis.
4. API Layer services query the databases to serve data to clients.
5. All service interactions are monitored and logged for observability.

## 6. Scalability and Performance

- Use of Kubernetes allows for easy horizontal scaling of microservices.
- Kafka enables high-throughput data ingestion and processing.
- Redis caching improves API response times for frequently accessed data.
- ClickHouse provides fast analytics queries on large datasets.

## 7. Security

- All API endpoints are secured with OAuth 2.0 and JWT.
- Data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest.
- API Gateway handles rate limiting and DDoS protection.
- Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted.

## 8. Disaster Recovery and High Availability

- Multi-AZ deployment in AWS for high availability.
- Regular backups of all databases.
- Kafka multi-broker setup for fault tolerance.
- Kubernetes pod anti-affinity rules to spread replicas across nodes.

## 9. Development Workflow

1. Developers work on feature branches.
2. Pull requests are created for code review.
3. GitLab CI runs tests and builds Docker images.
4. Upon approval and successful tests, changes are merged to main branch.
5. GitLab CI deploys to staging environment.
6. After QA approval, deployment to production is triggered.

## 10. Future Enhancements

- Implement a plugin system for custom data sources and transformations.
- Develop a DSL for defining custom data processing rules.
- Create SDKs in multiple languages for easier client integration.
- Expand to multi-cloud deployment for increased reliability and reduced vendor lock-in.

This design specification provides a comprehensive overview of the API as a Service platform. It covers the major components, technology choices, and architectural decisions. As the project progresses, this document should be updated to reflect any changes or refinements in the design.
